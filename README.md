Tapir is a member and shift management system of the food cooperative [SuperCoop Berlin](https://supercoop.de).
Our Vorstand and member office uses Tapir to manage shifts and members, for example their personal data, capabilities,
payments and shift statuses. It is also used for automatic mails and evaluate new applicants.
Members can use Tapir to register or unregister for shifts, search for a stand-in and see their shift status as well as
upcoming shifts.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)

Please note that while the actual program runs in a Docker container, you're adviced to install packages locally in
order to use your IDE properly. For that you need a C Compiler such as gcc for Linux or the Visual C++ Build tools.

### Install

1. Clone the project.
2. Configure our pre-commit hooks: `poetry install && pre-commit install`

### Setup

Start by running:

```sh
docker compose up
```

This starts a container with an LDAP server and automatically loads the test data into the LDAP.

For local development and testing, set up the test database and load test data

```sh
# Create tables
docker compose exec web poetry run python manage.py migrate
# Load admin (password: admin) account
docker compose exec web poetry run python manage.py loaddata admin_account
# Load lots of test users & shifts
docker compose exec web poetry run python manage.py generate_test_data --reset_all
```

You then can find the local instance of Tapir at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). Login with username and
password `roberto.cortes` to get started.

## Troubleshooting

* On macOS, in order to set up a local Python `venv`, you might have to install Postgresql to get `psycopg2` working.
  Use `brew install postgresql` for that.
