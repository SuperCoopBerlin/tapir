        <p>
            We are thrilled to welcome you aboard and begin running SuperCoop together
            with you!

        <p>See below for key details to kickstart your SuperCoop membership:</p>
        <h2>1. Member Office</h2>

        </p>
        <h2>3. Hygiene Training</h2>
        <p>
            New members must complete an online hygiene training from METRO BEFORE their first shift:
            <a href="https://kw.my/jEM8PK/#/">https://kw.my/jEM8PK/#/</a>. The training takes about 30 minutes and ends with
            a short questionnaire. If you answer
            80% of the questions correctly, you will receive a certificate. Please show this to an employee during your
            first shift.
        </p>
        <p>
            During your first shift, the team leader or an employee will provide an additional 10 minute introduction and
            show you the most important stations and rules in the store. If you could not do the online training at home,
            there is also the possibility to do it at our Welcome Desk during your shift.
        </p>
        <h2>4. Member Card</h2>
        <p>
            Your Member Card can be activated through your Tapir account. Member cards are consent based because we use them
            to collect data regarding the sum of the total purchase as well as the frequency of purchases. We use this
            information to support our financial planning and calculate projections of future revenues. It also helps us
            understand if certain measures we are taking to improve the assortment are having an impact on how regularly
            people shop at the coop. Conversely, if we see the regularity or total sum of purchases drop, we know we have to
            investigate this further. In this way, using the member card to track certain data also helps us better
            understand the needs of our members!
        </p>
        <p>
            To learn more about the member card and data collection, please visit our wiki:
            <a href="https://wiki.supercoop.de/wiki/Mitgliederkarte">https://wiki.supercoop.de/wiki/Mitgliederkarte</a>. Any
            concerns about data protection can be addressed to our data
            protection officer and working group at <a href="mailto:datenschutz-supercoop@posteo.de">datenschutz-supercoop@posteo.de</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Hereâ€™s how it works:</h3>
        <div>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Log into your Tapir profile: <a href="https://members.supercoop.de/">https://members.supercoop.de/</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Scroll down and you will see an option to give your consent, including an explanation of what data we
                    are
                    collecting. (Please note that you can give or remove consent at any time with just one click.)
                </li>
                <li>Once you have given consent, you will see a barcode that has been created especially for you.</li>
                <li>
                    The final and most important step (besides giving consent of course) is to remember to scan it at the
                    checkout counter! You have different options for how you can do this, including: logging into Tapir on
                    your
                    phone and showing it from there, downloading it as a PDF and saving it to your phone, taking a
                    screenshot,
                    or printing it out! (We're happy to print them out for you in the shop if needed!)
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <p>
            Last, but not certainly least, you can also load credit onto your member card and use it to pay for your
            groceries! This helps both you and the coop avoid transaction fees when making a purchase, and it can be done
            directly at the checkout counter (Kasse)! ðŸŽ‰
        </p>
        <h2>5. Working groups</h2>
        <p>
            Your <strong>Working Group</strong> tells you <strong>what kind of work you do</strong> in the Coop.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Please note:</strong> The most important thing is to select a shift time which you can consistently
            attend. As we are self-organised, we rely on the individual responsibility of each member to attend their shift
            and keep SuperCoop running.
        </p>
        <div>
            Members (barring any exceptional cases) should complete their first six shifts with one of the following core
            working groups:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Receiving and Stocking</strong> (receiving deliveries, keeping our shelves and coolers stocked,
                    and
                    checking expiration dates - Rote Karte not required)
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Cashier</strong>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Welcome Desk</strong> (greeting people at the store entrance, checking member numbers and
                    answering
                    visitors' questions about SuperCoop)
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Maintenance</strong> (cleaning the coop after closing)
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
            Please note that working groups and tasks dynamically adapt to the development of SuperCoop and are constantly
            updated. You may change working groups as needed.
        </p>
        <p>
            You also have opportunities to get involved at SuperCoop in addition to your regular shift. To make it as easy
            as
            possible for you to get started, we have summarized all <a href="https://wiki.supercoop.de/wiki/Working_Groups">additional
            working groups</a> in the wiki. Please see the Wiki for further information on how to get involved.
