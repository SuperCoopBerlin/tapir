                As you wished in your cancellation letter your membership will run until the end of the regular cancellation period specified in our Articles of Association, i.e.
                until the end of the financial year in three years. Please note the passage stated in our Articles of Association
                under <b>ยง4 Termination of membership, transfer of business assets, death and exclusion</b>.
                As a precaution, the articles of association are attached to this e-mail.

                <b>As your membership will continue to run as normal for the next three years and is still entered as "active" in Tapir,
                    we would like to take this opportunity to point out that you can continue to complete shifts in the next three years
                    and therefore retain your right to shop. If you no longer wish to complete shifts or shop in Supercoop, we would ask you to apply to
                    the member-office ({{ contact_email_address }}) to switch your membership to "investing".
                </b>
            </p>
            <p>
                This will prevent your shift backlog from going into the red and you from receiving emails with warnings from us in the future.
