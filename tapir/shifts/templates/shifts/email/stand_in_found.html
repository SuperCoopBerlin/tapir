    <p>Dear {{ first_name }},</p>

    <p>This is an automated email from {{ coop_name }}.</p>

    <p>
        You were looking for a stand-in for the following shift: {{ shift_display_name }}.<br/>
        Another member has taken over your slot for that shift.
    </p>

    <p>If you haven't done so already, don't forget to attend another shift to compensate for the one you will miss!</p>
