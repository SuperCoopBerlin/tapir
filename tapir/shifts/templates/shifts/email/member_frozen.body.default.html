        <p>Hi {{ display_name_short }},</p>
        <p>
            This is an automated email from {{ coop_name }}. This is to kindly inform you that your Tapir account at
            SuperCoop has been temporarily frozen. Unfortunately, your shift log has been below {{ freeze_threshold }}
            shifts for more than {{ freeze_after_days }} days.
        </p>
        <p>
            While your account is frozen, you cannot shop or vote in the General Assembly.
        </p>
        <p>
            To unfreeze your account, simply sign up for your outstanding shifts as catch-up shifts. Please note that
            these shifts must be within the next {{ nb_weeks_in_the_future_for_make_up_shifts }} weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
            So please sign up for your outstanding shifts as soon as possible. For more information on the shift system,
            please see the <a href="{{ url_member_manual }}">Member Manual</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thank you very much!
        </p>
        <p>
            Cooperative greetings<br />
            The Member Office
        </p>
