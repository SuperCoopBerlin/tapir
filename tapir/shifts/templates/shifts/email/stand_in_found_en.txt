Dear {{ tapir_user.first_name }},

This is an automated email coming from Supercoop.

You were looking for a stand-in for the following shift: {{ shift.get_display_name }}.
Another member took over your slot for that shift.

If it's not done already, don't forget to attend another shift to compensate for the one you're not attending!

Cooperatively yours,
