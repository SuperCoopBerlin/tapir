Dear {{ tapir_user.first_name }},

This is an automated email from SuperCoop.

You were looking for a stand-in for the following shift: {{ shift.get_display_name }}.
Another member has taken over your slot for that shift.

If you haven't done so already, don't forget to attend another shift to compensate for the one you will miss!

Cooperatively yours,
