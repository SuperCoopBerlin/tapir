            Hi {{ display_name_short }},
        </p>

        <p>
            This is an automated email from {{ coop_name }}. This is to kindly inform you that your shift log has
            reached {{ account_balance }}.
        </p>

        <p>
            You now have {{ freeze_after_days }} days to register for the outstanding shifts as make-up shifts. These shifts
            must be within the next {{ nb_weeks_in_the_future }} weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please note: If you do not sign up for your catch-up shifts within the next {{ freeze_after_days }} days,
            your account will be frozen. This means you will not be able to shop or vote in general meetings. To
            unfreeze your account, you will need to sign up for your outstanding shifts.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are an ABCD member and do not complete your catch-up shifts, nor your regular shifts, you will be
            removed from your ABCD shift.
        </p>
        <p>
            So please sign up for your outstanding shifts as soon as possible. For more information on the shift system,
            please see the <a href="{{ url_member_manual }}">Member Manual</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thank you!
        </p>
        <p>
            Cooperative greetings, <br />
            The member office
        </p>
