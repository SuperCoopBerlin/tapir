Hi {{ tapir_user.first_name }},

This is an automated email from Supercoop.

It has been registered in the Tapir system that you didn't attend the following shift, even though you were registered to it :
{{ shift.get_display_name }}
If it's a mistake, or you think that you should be excused from that shift, contact the member office : mitglied@supercoop.de .
As is written in the Member Manuel, a missed shift must be compensated for by 2 make-up shifts.

Cooperatively yours,
