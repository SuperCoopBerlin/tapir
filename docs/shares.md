# Shares

Each member can own shares of the organisation.

A share has a start date and an optional end date.
The start date is usually the date at which the member is created.
The end date is used for two cases :

- When a share is transferred from a member to another. In that case, the share of the giving member gets the transfer
  date as end date. A new share gets created for the receiving member, with the transfer date as start date.
- When a member sells their share back to the organisation.

A share without an end date is considered valid forever.

## Creating more shares

A member can buy more shares from the organisation. This can be done from the member's page by clicking the "Add shares"
button. That button is visible after clicking "details" next to the user's number of shares.

Creating more shares will send a confirmation email to the member, with a confirmation PDF attached.

## Accounting recap

At midnight every sunday (in the night from Saturday to Sunday), an email gets sent to the accounting email address. In
the email is the list of all new members with the amount of shares they got created with, and the list of extra shares
that got bought by existing members. For each of those entry, the email contains a link to download the PDF
confirmation.

## Matching program

Members can register to the "Matching Program" to signify that they are willing to pay for the share of a potential new
member that could not afford it themselves.

The date of the registration is stored, so that the members who are the longest in the program get asked first about
gifting opportunities.

When "gifting" a share, the gifting member actually never gets the share added to their account. Instead, the share gets
created on the receiving member's account, but the payment is registered with the gifting member as "paying member" and
the receiving member as "credited member". See the payment document.
